# Google_drive_layout


Creating a Google Drive layout clone using HTML and CSS involves designing the front-end user interface that replicates the look and feel of the Google Drive platform.

The layout can be divided into several components, including the header, sidebar, main content area, and footer. The header section usually includes the Google Drive logo, a search bar, and user account settings. The sidebar can contain a navigation menu for accessing different sections of the Google Drive platform, such as My Drive, Shared with me, and Recent.
